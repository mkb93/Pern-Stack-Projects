a simple crud application

To run on local machine:
  1. install node and nodemon
  2. on terminal go to folder server and type nodemon index.js
  2a. have react installed (i think hmmm)
  3. open another terminal go to folder client and type npm start app

problems you may face:
  the future has changed everything ( todays date is 20/1/2024)
  you may have other applications using the ports i defined so you'll have them from port 5000 and 3000. (i recommend using chat gpt if you dont know where to do this)
